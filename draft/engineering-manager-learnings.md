# Things I've Learned as an Engineering Manager

If I don't write a task down, in my own physical notebook, it probably won't happen.

If I don't yet feel I'm repeating myself, I probably haven't said it enough.

If I have a 1:1 scheduled with a team member at all, it's always worth talking for at least 15 minutes, even if it starts with no agenda and "I'm doing fine". Sometimes especially so.

Calling out a problem is not the same as fixing a problem. Fixing is usually much harder.

Visibility is not the same as importance.

The further away a system is from the customer, the the less automatically it will get attention and investment into it. Internal awareness is critical for hidden systems and maintenance work.
