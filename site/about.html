      <h1 class="intro">Hi, I’m Ryan Artecona.</h1>
      <p>
        I am a Director of Engineering at
        <a href="http://wistia.com" title="Wistia">Wistia</a> where I manage our
        infrastructure and backend-heavy teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've taken a meandering path to what I do today. My first taste of
        programming was in high school, learning Java. I didn't like it. I
        stumbled into it again later in college, building websites with
        JavaScript and Python, which was much more fun. I kept coding while I
        studied Philosophy, and I became a frontend engineer after graduating.
        From there, I branched out to learn and own whatever the teams around me
        needed supporting the most, which led me to operate servers, administer
        databases, overhaul cloud infrastructure, run blameless postmortems, and
        negotiate vendor contracts. More and more these days, I'm focused on
        building healthy teams of collaborative engineers that I can empower to
        do impactful work.
