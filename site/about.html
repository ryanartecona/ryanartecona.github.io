      <h1 class="intro">Hi, I’m Ryan Artecona.</h1>
      <p>
        I work at <a href="http://wistia.com" title="Wistia">Wistia</a> as a
        Senior Software Engineering Manager on the Infrastructure team.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started programming on the front end in HTML, CSS, and JS, like many
        others. My work at Wistia has gradually shifted from working on
        applications themselves to working on tools and systems and processes
        which support them. Happily, I write much less JS these days. You can
        read more about my background in my (outdated, most likely) <a
        href="/resume.pdf">résumé</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've learned to value simplicity over ease and semantics over
        aesthetics. I love using programming languages with strong type systems,
        and I'm enjoying ReasonML and OCaml the most recently. I reach for Nix
        when I have cause to package or install a program, or when I need to
        remind myself how much I love and hate computers.
