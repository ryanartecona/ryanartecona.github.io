      <h1 class="intro">Hi, I’m Ryan Artecona.</h1>
      <p>
        I work at <a href="http://wistia.com" title="Wistia">Wistia</a> as a
        Software Engineering Director with a focus on our more
        backend/infrastructure teams.

        My first taste of programming was in high school, learning Java. I
        didn't like it. I stumbled into it again later in college, building
        websites with JavaScript and Python, which was much more fun. I kept at
        it, became a frontend engineer after graduating, and from there branched
        out to operate servers, administer databases, overhaul cloud
        infrastructure, run blameless postmortems, and negotiate vendor
        contracts. More and more these days, I'm focused on building healthy
        teams that do impactful work. For more detail, see my <a
